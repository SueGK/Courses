- # Analyze Traffic Source
    - ## WEBSITE_SESSIONS Table
        - ### website_session_id [[website session]]
            - This is the primary key of the website sessions table.

        - ### created_at 
            - timestamp, which is when that session happened.
        - ### user_id
            - that is linked to the cookie in a user's browser. We use that to track users across multiple sessions.
        - ### is_repeat_session binary flag
            - So this is going to be a zero or a one, depending on whether or not this customer has been to the website before and that's identified.
        - **UTM Tracking parameters** that we use to measure our paid marketing activity.#[[UTM Tracking parameters]]
            - UTM campaign
            - UTM content.
            - UTM source
            - So when you see UTM parameters, this is what's used by **Google Analytics.**
            - And many ecommerce companies have adopted similar tracking conventions for their own internal database
            - so that you can use one set of parameters for both the Google Analytics implementation and for the internal database.
        - **device_type**
            - So device type helps us understand whether the user is on their computer or if they're on a mobile device
        - **http_refer** helps us understand where traffic is coming from.
            - This can be especially helpful for traffic that's coming to us, which we don't have tagged with paid tracking parameters because it's not through a marketing campaign.
            - We can look at referrer as another way to try to figure out where that traffic is coming from.
    - ## WEBSITE_PAGEVIEWS
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FFemFarm%2FAmnUzFLSwm.png?alt=media&token=0821d921-3baf-4681-bd60-79a01eeb1aba)
        - [[conversion analysis]]， [[funnel analysis]]
    - ## ORDERS
        - **cog**: cost of goods
        - we'll use that to understand revenue and to do [[margin analysis]] for our various products.
        - **primary product**:  being the product that a customer puts in their cart.

        - COMMON USE CASES: 
            - Finding the most-viewed pages that customers view on your site

        - **COMMON USE CASES:**
            - Identifying your top opportunities for landing pages – [[high volume pages]] with higher than expected [[bounce rates]] or low [[conversion rates]] .
            - Setting up [[A/B test]] experiments on your live traffic to see if you can improve your bounce rates and conversion rates 
            - Analyzing test results and making recommendations on which version of landing pages you should use going forward

            - [[~SQL]]
                - ```sql
Solution is a multi-step a query. See video for details
STEP 1: finding the first website_pageview_id for relevant sess ions
STEP 2: identifying the landing page of each session
STEP 3: counting pageviews for each sess ion, to identify "bounces™
STEP 4: summarizing by counting total sessions and bounced sess ions```
